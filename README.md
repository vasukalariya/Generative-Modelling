# Restricted Boltzmann Machines
![RBM Image](rbm.png)
## Implementation Details
* The implemented RBM consist of 2 layers with 784 visible units and 256 hidden units.
* Trained using K-Contrastive Divergence with k = 1.
* The RBM can be modified as per the use.
* It is built solely from scratch using NumPy.
* It is trained for MNIST Reconstruction and learning its probability distribution.
* Trained on 60000 images.
* It is modular in nature so you could change the parameters as per your choice.

## How to Use
* Download the train_images from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastianlapuschkin/lrp_toolbox/master/data/MNIST/train_images.npy)
* For sample demonstration a clipped image is reconstructed using trained RBM.
* The notebook is ready to run.

* The notations are also similar.



### Have Fun! Learning :smiley:
